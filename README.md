# LastOneMovesWin

A game where you select the amount of sticks in the pool and the valid number of sticks a player can take at the time. A bot will move first then it's your turn. The last player that takes the stick and empty the pool wins.


IMPORTANT: Have only tested with less than 50 total sticks in the pool. Larger may required more loading time
